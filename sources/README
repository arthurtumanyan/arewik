Synopsis

	Arewik is a gateway between ordinary plain text data generators and Nosql/BigData solutions.
	It can be used as a tool to store some program log files into the Hadoop,Riak,ElasticSearch or just
	store them into the local/remote disk.
	Actually, it was designed to accept squid log information via network and save them to Riak storage
	for further analysis. However, it can be used in various scenarios, as it accepts raw data on tcp socket,
	anything can be passed to Arewik to save. 
	
	ex: tcpdump -np -w - |nc arewikhost arewikport
	    tail -f /var/log/apache/access.log | nc arewikhost arewikport
	It supports gzip and snappy compression for local, and snappy only compression for remote storages
